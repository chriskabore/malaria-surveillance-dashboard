# Malaria Surveillance Dashboard (Simulated Data)

This project presents a prototype of a malaria surveillance dashboard built with **Power BI**, using simulated data derived from real administrative health structures in Burkina Faso. It demonstrates how simple data visualizations can support public health decision-making at the district and national level.

---

## 📊 Objective

The goal is to show how digital tools can:
- Track confirmed malaria cases and deaths by month and district
- Identify high-risk areas for intervention
- Monitor the coverage of Mass Drug Administration (MDA) campaigns
- Evaluate reporting completeness across health facilities

This type of dashboard could be used by ministries of health, technical partners (e.g. CHAI), or NGOs involved in malaria control and NTD programs.

## 📁 Data Description

The file `malaria_cases_sample_fis_structures.csv` contains monthly simulated data for 10 districts, based on the naming of real health structures from the Ministry of Health (FIS - Burkina Faso). Each row includes:

- `Month`: Reporting period (YYYY-MM)
- `Region`: Simulated regional assignment
- `District`: Health district / structure name
- `Cases_Confirmed`: Number of confirmed malaria cases
- `Deaths`: Number of reported deaths
- `Population`: Estimated local population
- `MDA_Coverage (%)`: Simulated MDA coverage rate
- `Health_Facilities_Reporting (%)`: Reporting completeness
